📊 Banking Default Loan – Credit Risk Analysis (J.P. Morgan Quant Research)



🧠 Overview



Banking\_Default\_Loan is a predictive modeling project designed as part of the J.P. Morgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Internship on Forage.

This notebook applies data science and quantitative finance techniques to assess loan default risk, analyze borrower behavior, and model credit probability using real-world-inspired datasets.



🎯 Objective



To develop a data-driven model that estimates the probability of loan default based on borrower and loan attributes — enabling financial institutions to balance profitability and risk exposure.



🧮 Mathematical Foundation



The project leverages Logistic Regression, a probabilistic model that estimates the likelihood of default
